# Involute Sans

A contemporary Bangla & English geometric sans-serif typeface, crafted with precision and mathematical harmony for today's digital and print world.

## Overview

Involute Sans is the result of a unique collaboration between Involute Tech, founded by Nowab Md. Aminul Haq, and Bengal Fonts, led by Thouhedul Islam Himel. Rooted in the harmony of the Fibonacci sequence and the Golden Ratio, each character, Bangla and Latin alike has been meticulously shaped to achieve balance, rhythm, and timeless elegance.

Designed to perform seamlessly in both digital and print applications, Involute Sans offers clarity, efficiency, and versatility making it ideal for corporate branding, web design, software UI, editorial content, and presentations. Its geometry conserves space while maintaining readability and visual refinement.

More than just a typeface, Involute Sans reflects the shared vision of Involute Tech and Bengal Fonts: to merge innovation, mathematics, and Bengali cultural identity into a design system that speaks with professionalism and artistry.
